# Lion5 Component Library 🎉

This is the Lion5 Component Library. It includes all shared vue3 ui components.

## How to use
Add the library with the following command 
```sh
npm install @lion5/component-library
```

## How to develop
We are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop new components and to display the documentation for them.
Please refer to the [Vue Styleguidist Docs](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/docs/Documenting.html) for updating or writing new component documentations.

To start storybook run:
```sh
npm run storybook
```
To build the library locally use:
```sh
npm run build-storybook
```
