# Lion5 Component Library üéâ

This is the Lion5 Component Library. It includes all shared vue3 ui components.

## How To Use
- First you need to add a `.npmrc` to your project root
  - add the following line `//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_PACKAGE_TOKEN}` (This is required to be able to install the package in the CI)
  - add the following line `@lion5:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com` (this changes the registry to GitHub for all packages under the `@lion5` namespace)
- Then you need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub to be able to download the package locally
  1. Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens (classic) and create a new one
  2. Configuration as follows (only read:packages permission):

- After that you need to log in using the generated PAT `npm login --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope @lion5`
  (might need `--auth-type=legacy`)
  - username is the GitHub username
  - password is the PAT
- Install the package:
```shell
npm install @lion5/component-library
pnpm add "@lion5/component-library"
yarn add @lion5/component-library
```
- To be able to run it in GitHub Actions add the following to the root of your workflows
  - See also https://docs.npmjs.com/using-private-packages-in-a-ci-cd-workflow and
  https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions#installing-a-package-using-an-action
```yml
permissions:
  contents: 'read'
  packages: 'read'

env:
  GITHUB_PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## How To Develop
We are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop new components and to display the documentation for them.
Please refer to the [Vue Styleguidist Docs](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/docs/Documenting.html) for updating or writing new component documentations.

To start storybook to render the documentation run:
```sh
npm run docs
```
To build the docs locally use:
```sh
npm run docs:build
```

## How To Release
‚ùóÔ∏è Before creating a release with your changes, check the following ‚ùóÔ∏è
- [ ] New components are documented in a `.stories.js` Story file, and in the respective component file, the props and
exposed events / methods are annotated using [code comments](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/docs/Documenting.html#code-comments)
- [ ] Make sure the documentation can be built (see command above - will be verified by CI as well)
- [ ] Please test that your component works properly, by adding a `.spec.{ts|js}` file next to it.
- [ ] New components (atoms, icons, layouts) need to be registered in the respective `index.ts` file, e.g. `src/atoms/index.ts`.

Then:

- Merge all changes to the main branch (by creating a PR - which needs to be approved first)
- checkout main branch
- run `npm version <vX.X.X|patch|...>` (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version) to update the `package.json` version and auto tag commit
- push the newly generated tag to GitHub (e.g. `git push origin vX.X.X`)
- create a new release for the tag in GitHub
- create a new PR with the new tag into `main`

1. Run the release workflow using the Actions tab
   - Select the release type (major, minor, patch) and run the release on main branch

2. After that the workflow creates a release PR after a while. This PR need to be approved, merged and the branch deleted.

The workflow should have done the following things:
- Create a new GitHub release
- Publish a new package to the GitHub Packages registry
- Publish a new documentation on GitHub Pages
